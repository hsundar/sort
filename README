COMPILE AND EXECUTE

Change the environment variable WORK_DIR in run.pbs to the current directory.

Also, set the OMP_NUM_THREADS variable and the program arguments to specify the 
total number of points.

Add the option -D USE_OLD_SORT to CXXFLAGS in Makefile if you want to use the 
older version of the par::sampleSort(...).

Now compile and execute using:

./run.sh
