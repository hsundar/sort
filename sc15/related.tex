\section{Background}
Keep related work here and separate from introduction. some glue text here before we go into separate subsections on the energy aspects and the algorithmic aspects of sorting.

\paragraph{Code variant tuning}
Apart from Nitro~\cite{muralidharan:2014},
several programmer-directed autotuning frameworks support
tuning of code/algorithmic variants.
Petabricks~\cite{PetaBricks} 
supports user specification of \textit{transforms} that
are analogous to functions. Transforms are automatically
composed together to form hybrid algorithms using a compiler
framework and an adaptive algorithm~\cite{increa11}. Petabricks, however,
implicitly tunes variants for the size of the input data set. Ding et
al.~\cite{ding:2015} propose extensions to the PetaBricks language to
enable support for tuning based on arbitrary input features.

\paragraph{Multi-objective optimization}
