\begin{abstract}
Sorting is an essential building block for several algorithms and application. In this work we improve the energy efficiency of distributed sorting by proposing a new algorithm that avoids communication whenever possible. In addition, we analyze the most energy and power efficient sorting strategies on GPUs and Heterogeneous system architectures.

\section{Introduction}
General overview on why this work is relavant. Motivate and connect to a larger set of problems. Highlight contributions and list limitations.


\section{Background}
Keep related work here and separate from introduction. some glue text here before we go into separate subsections on the energy aspects and the algorithmic aspects of sorting.

\subsection{energy considerations on GPUs}

\subsection{sorting algorithms}
review popular distributed sorting algorithms. Talk briefly about communication avoiding algorithms and with our prior work on HykSort.

\section{Distributed Sorting}

Here describe the actual sorting algorithms used.

\section{Experimental Setup}

Talk about architectures used, how we measure energy etc.

\section{Results}


\section{Discussion}
Discuss results and what the key findings are and what it means for future architectures.
